      <description>From late September to early October I was on a 9-day mission to Tirana.
The project aims to assist the Albanian High Judicial Council (HJC) to better exercise its mandate to monitor court performance, and will in response to a specific request from the HJC focus on the backlog situation in four courts in Tirana. The initiative is part of a justice sector project implemented by East-West Management Institute (EWMI), and is financed by the US Department of State, Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL).</description>

      <description>On September 20 I participated (online) in the Justice and Anticorruption Reforms Forum in Moldova. The conference was organized by the Legal Resources Centre (LRCM).
In my presentation on court optimization I had the opportunity to reflect upon my previous collaboration with LRCM to analyze the judicial map in Moldova. I also gave a brief demonstration of a software application to compare various judicial map designs.
A recording of the entire conference is available on Youtube.</description>

      <description>Participated in the inaugural JAR-association congress ‚ÄòInnovation in Judicial Systems: Human, Cyber and Beyond‚Äô in Rome.
I presented a paper titled &amp;ldquo;Explaining cross-country differences in the number of judges per capita&amp;rdquo;. Here is the abstract:
It is rather common to focus on the number professional judges per capita when assessing the need for judges in various countries. The EU Rule of Law Report is just one example of this tendency. This simple indicator does however not take into account that the demand for justice in different countries may vary quite a lot because of socio-economic factors.</description>

      <description>As with color themes, you can completely customize your site&amp;rsquo;s fonts within minutes of creating a new site. How you do it depends on how much control and customization you need.
Embedded fonts Hugo Ap√©ro includes 6 embedded fonts that work &amp;ldquo;out of the box.&amp;rdquo; We selected 3 serif and 3 sans-serif options that we thought looked good with this theme, in our humble opinions. All embedded fonts include real italics so you may emphasize to your heart&amp;rsquo;s content ‚ù§Ô∏è!</description>

      <description>Rendering mathematical equations Examples from the mathjax demo. But they work with katex as well.
Rmarkdown In .Rmarkdown documents, you can use either
$a \ne 0$ to get inline math: \(a \ne 0\). There is no conflict with using dollar symbols regularly, because knitr automatically escapes freestanding dollar symbols.
And you can use
$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$ to get a math paragraph:
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.</description>

      <description>Courtesy of panelset.js by Garrick Aden-Buie, from his xaringanExtra package: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra/#/panelset
For example, this panelset:
Hello! üëã hello
Goodbye üí® goodbye
Was created by combining this theme&amp;rsquo;s panelset and panel shortcodes:
{{&amp;lt; panelset class=&amp;#34;greetings&amp;#34; &amp;gt;}} {{&amp;lt; panel name=&amp;#34;Hello! :wave:&amp;#34; &amp;gt;}} hello {{&amp;lt; /panel &amp;gt;}} {{&amp;lt; panel name=&amp;#34;Goodbye :dash:&amp;#34; &amp;gt;}} goodbye {{&amp;lt; /panel &amp;gt;}} {{&amp;lt; /panelset &amp;gt;}} You could also revert to HTML as well. For example, this panelset:
Question Which came first: the üêî or the ü•ö?</description>

Since I began building websites in Y2K, I&amp;rsquo;ve lost count how many times the phrase &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;there&amp;rsquo;s got to be a better way to do this&amp;rdquo; has passed my lips. Most times, while fighting with floats and widths of content and sidebars or just basically trying to get something beside something else without using a stupid TABLE.</description>

      <description>Tachyons is a design system that allows you to design gorgeous interfaces in the browser with little effort. Because Speed See here for a brief explainer.
Together with professor Peter Bogetoft from Copenhagen Business School, I have also published a more technical academic article on smart case weighting in the scientific journal Omega.
In using this theme for your next static website project, you won&amp;rsquo;t need to know anything about Tachyons &amp;hellip; so, don&amp;rsquo;t freak out.</description>
