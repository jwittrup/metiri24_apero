# Smart case weighting
Any serious assessment of judicial performance - whether at court or individual level - requires some sort of case weighting. Unfortunately, the traditional approach to case weighting is very time-consuming. In addition the adopted weights need to be updated and reassessed frequently. 

As a faster, more cost-effective and more robust alternative, I have developed a methodology for "smart case weighting". See [here](https://bookdown.org/connect/#/apps/3320/access) for a brief explainer. 

Together with professor [Peter Bogetoft](https://research.cbs.dk/en/persons/peter-bogetoft) from Copenhagen Business School, I have also published a more technical academic article on smart case weighting in the scientific journal [Omega](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305048320307295).



# Interactive web applications
 I provide interactive web-applications designed to support data-driven judicial management. In several cases I have cooperated with East-West Manage Institute (EWMI) to develop data-driven sulotions. See more [here](https://ewmi.org/News/PROLOGApr2020).
