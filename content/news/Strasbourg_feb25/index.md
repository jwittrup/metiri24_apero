What happens to a country's economy when judicial independence erodes? I explored this crucial question at this week's ASSEDEL conference in Strasbourg on the growing pressures facing independent judiciaries. Honored to share insights alongside distinguished colleagues, with special thanks to Fredrik Sundberg for moderating this important dialogue. My presentation starts from 2:20 in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuLy2WShFkA).
