Simple comparison of the number of judges per capita gives only limited information about relative judicial needs. As I show in a recently [published article](https://iacajournal.org/articles/10.36745/ijca.581), one also must consider social, demographic, political and economic variables, as well as systemic differences between the compared judiciaries. 

The particular methodology applied in this paper has been developed as part of a project for assessing the need for judges in Georgia.
