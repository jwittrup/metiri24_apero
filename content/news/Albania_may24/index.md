The High Judicial Council of Albania has approved the new backlog reduction strategy.

A thorough analysis of available data has made clear that in order to achieve substantial backlog reduction it is necessary to increase current judge productivity. The strategy therefore focuses on initiatives aimed at helping courts to increase productivity.  

The support for the development of the strategy has been implemented by [East-West Management Institute (EWMI)](https://ewmi.org/), and was financed by the US Department of State, Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL).
