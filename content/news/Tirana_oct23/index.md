From late September to early October I was on a 9-day mission to Tirana.

The project aims to assist the Albanian High Judicial Council (HJC) to better exercise its mandate to monitor court performance, and will in response to a specific request from the HJC focus on the backlog situation in four courts in Tirana. The initiative is part of a justice sector project implemented by [East-West Management Institute (EWMI)](https://ewmi.org/), and is financed by the US Department of State, Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL). 

On the mission I visited the 4 courts (the Court of Appeal, the Administrative Court of Appeal, Tirana District Court and the first instance administrative court) in order to review performance data and to discuss potential mechanisms to increase adjucication rates. 

It is good to cooperate yet again with the strong local EWMI-office in Tirana.
