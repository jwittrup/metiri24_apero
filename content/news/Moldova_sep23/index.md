On September 20 I participated (online) in the Justice and Anticorruption Reforms Forum in Moldova. The conference was organized by the [Legal Resources Centre](https://crjm.org/en/) (LRCM). 

In my presentation on court optimization I had the opportunity to reflect upon my previous collaboration with LRCM to analyze the judicial map in Moldova. I also gave a brief [demonstration](https://youtu.be/J9XjQZqc8HI) of a software application to compare various judicial map designs. 

A recording of the entire conference is available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd7RMZTSAUY&t=2690s).
