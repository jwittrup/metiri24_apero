subtitle: "Making rule of law efficient"
description: "The aim with my international projects is to improve efficiency in justice. I have a strong track record of making sense out of complex and noisy data. I have pioneered the development of a smart case weighting system which allows for a more robust and cost-effective assessment of judicial workload and allocation of resources. In addition, I provide interactive web-applications designed to support data-driven judicial management."
